/*
Write a program to create a deck of cards, initialize the deck, shuffle the deck, and distribute the deck of n cards to x number of players. Finally, print the cards the players have.
Hint =>
Create a deck of cards with suits "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades" and ranks from "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King", and "Ace".
