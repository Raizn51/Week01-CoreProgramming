/*
Number Guessing Game
Problem Statement: Create a Java program where the user thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and
the computer tries to guess the number by generating random guesses. The user provides feedback by
indicating whether the guess is high, low, or correct. The program should be modular, with different
functions for generating guesses, receiving user feedback, and determining the next guess.
